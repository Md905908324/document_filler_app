Template Creation Guide for Document Filler App

The Document Filler App automatically fills templates using data from an Excel file with matching keys. Here's how to create them:

- **Word Templates**: Use Microsoft Word to add bookmarks or content controls. For data insertion, enclose keys in double curly braces, e.g., {{Client_Name}} or {{Date}}. The app will replace these with corresponding Excel values.

- **PDF Templates**: Create PDFs with interactive form fields using tools like Adobe Acrobat. Name fields to match Excel keys (e.g., "Client_Name", "CheckBox1"). The app will fill these fields with the same keys from your Excel data, supporting text, checkboxes (set with "1" or "0"), and choice fields (e.g., dropdowns with option values).

Keep field names consistent with Excel keys, test with sample data, and ensure PDFtk is set up for PDFs. Refer to the log (`~/Documents/document_filler.log`) for debugging.
